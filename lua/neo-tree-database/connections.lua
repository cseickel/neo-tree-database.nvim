--[[
The connections the tree starts from.

vim-dadbod-ui keeps its connections in a json file, and this plugin reads that
same file rather than introducing a second list, so a config that already names
its databases needs no new configuration. `g:dbs` is read too, because that is
where vim-dadbod itself looks.

Nothing here writes. A connection is added by editing the file, which is how
that file was already being maintained.
